I take all security vulnerabilities seriously. Thank you for improving the security of my script :) I appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Report security vulnerabilities by emailing me :

I will acknowledge your email within 48 hours, and will send a more detailed response within 96 hours indicating the next steps in handling your report. 
After the initial reply to your report, I will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.
